# Knuth-Morris-Pratt-Boyer-Moore-Algorithm-In-SCALA
The objective of the targeted advanced programs is to implement to algorithm used for pattern searching and show the number of 
comparisons they take for finding the specific pattern. The two algorithms used are: 
    - ● Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm - O(m+n) 
    - ● Boyer-Moore algorithm-O(n+m)
Since both the algorithm have same time complexity for worst case, they perform different for different situations/inputs.
